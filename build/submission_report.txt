Mineral Targeting Analysis Report
================================

Date: 2025-04-08

Methodology:
- Used Random Forest Regressor to predict copper, iron, and gold concentrations.
- Incorporated additional features: Ni_ppm, Zn_ppm, Pb_ppm, scaled with StandardScaler.
- Optimized model with n_estimators=200 and max_depth=10.
- Identified high-potential zones using the top 5% of predicted values.
- Visualized data with scatter plots and heatmaps.

Model Performance:
- Mean Squared Error for Copper: 935.87
- Mean Squared Error for Iron: 8.08
- Mean Squared Error for Gold: 23.57

High-Potential Zones:
- Copper Zones (>66.57 ppm): 501 locations
- Iron Zones (>10.62 %): 501 locations
- Gold Zones (>4.14 ppb): 501 locations
